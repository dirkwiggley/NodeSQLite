# NodeSQLite
A Node/TypeScript back end that uses better-sqlite3 to provide services

This project is intended to be a starting point for any Node based backend you might want to build. 

The .env file and database file provided is for testing purposes only. You can use this to launch the app right after setting up the app with these files. They contain all of the seed data that you would need to do some basic looking around at what you have to start. Seriously, you'll want a new .env file if you're going to use this for anything other than goofing around!

This app provides a framework for authentication and database access.
